## Installation ##
Below are brief instructions on how to install:

You will need node.js with the inquirer package. You can download the basic javascript files to build the readme, but they have dependencies on node.js and inquirer. If you clone the repo, then you can simply run npm init -y in the terminal from the folder directory, and then install inquirer using npm install inquirer.  You will also need to set up a mysql instance (we used JAWS_DB on heroku), and a .env to run locally
