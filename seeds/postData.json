    "description": "When you gain access to Jevelin, a multi-purpose site canvas, you unlock yourself tons of options and possibilities. Even as a blogger, you can enjoy using the amazing predefined layouts that Jevelin has in store for you. Those are very appealing to the eye, modern and clean looking, versatile enough to cater to all sorts of ideas out of the box. In some instances, you will not even want to change the default demo and just use it as is. When this occurs, you can begin releasing new compelling material straight away.!"

    "description": "Ben Nadel is a NY-based programmer, co-founder, and principal engineer at InVision App, Inc, a design and user experience (UX) company. His blog — sometimes known as “The Kinky Solutions” blog — documents his programming experimentation. The blog has a huge collection of useful and in-depth articles which is a treasure trove for any web developer. The nearly 15-year-old blog is an excellent vector for demonstrating Nadel’s technical expertise and strong technical programming knowledge. The blog’s writing quality is excellent, and I found it clean, concise, and thought-provoking. Expect several new articles every month, if not more."
